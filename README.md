# cs494-internetworking-project

This is a repo for our cs494 Internetworking protocols project!

Currently this is a straight rip-off of the `getting started` tutorial from socket.io found at https://socket.io/get-started/chat/ Everyone has to get started somewhere right?

# How to run this code

This is a Node.js project, we are running node `v8.11.1`

After cloning this project cd into the repo:

```
cd cs494-internetworking-project/
```

Then setup the project on your system by running:

```
npm i
```

After waiting for NPM to do its thing you should be able to run the project by running:

```
node index.js
```

Then in your favorite browser navigate to:

```
localhost:3000
```

to see that app do its thing. If you go that location on more than one tab you can chat with yourself, HOORAY!
